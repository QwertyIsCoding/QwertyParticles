# QwertyParticles
Python scripts to create different types of particle generations in Blender!
---
Project in progress
The last part of the code annotated with "Blender code" or something like that has to be changed with the "Blender code" of the particle... By that, I mean that you can  change that part of the code to spawn different particle meshes. For example, in the code, it is a smooth sphere but you can change it to be a cube etc. This is available in the "Scripting" workspace in Blender. Here is an example of a monkey.
